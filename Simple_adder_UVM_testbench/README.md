#Simple UVM Testbench 

This project is to introduce SystemVerilog and UVM to get a better understanding of the process and UVM's components. This tutorial is a modified version to implement new changes ourselves to get a better understanding. Instead of working on the given ALU in the video, the design is a full adder.
