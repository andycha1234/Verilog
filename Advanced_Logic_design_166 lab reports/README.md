#CSUS 166 Advanced Logic Design

VHDL and Verilog Hardware Description Languages are studied and used on the following advanced level logic design topics: 
- synchronous state machines
- asynchronous state machines
- metastability
- hazards
- races
- testability
- boundary scan
- scan chains
- built-in self-tests

Commercial Electronic Design Automation (EDA) toolsets are used to synthesize lab projects containing a hierarchy of modules into Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs).
Post synthesis simulations by these same tools verify the design before implementation on rapid prototyping boards in the lab.
